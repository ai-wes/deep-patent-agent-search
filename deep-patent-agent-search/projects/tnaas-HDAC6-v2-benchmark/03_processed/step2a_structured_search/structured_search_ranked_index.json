Among the numerous malignant tumors in human, digestive system cancers \nare the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Acetylation and deacetylation \nare crucially involved in cancer occurrence and development; in addition, the \ndeacetylation process is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Among the 18 \nhuman HDACs that have been reported, HDAC6 has been widely studied. There is \nupregulated HDAC6 expression in numerous types of tumor tissues and is closely \nassociated with clinicopathological characteristics. Moreover, several HDAC6 \ninhibitors have been identified; furthermore, there has been extensive research \non their ability to inhibit the growth of many tumors. This review summarizes \nthe roles of HDAC6 in different primary digestive system malignancies.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Zhou, Liu and Tan.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcell.2021.719390\nPMCID: PMC8687743",

Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 and genetic \nknockout/knockdown studies as a therapeutic strategy in PNS and CNS indications \nwere analyzed. Furthermore, we describe the recent developments in HDAC6 PET \ntracers and their utility in CNS indications. Finally, we explore the \nadvancements and challenges with HDAC6 inhibitor compounds, such as hydroxamic \nacid, fluoromethyl oxadiazoles, HDAC6 degraders, and thiol-based inhibitors.\nEXPERT OPINION: Based on extensive preclinical evidence, pharmacological \ninhibition of HDAC6 is a promising approach for treating both PNS and CNS \ndisorders, given its involvement in neurodegeneration and aging-related cellular \nprocesses. Despite the progress in the development of selective HDAC6 \ninhibitors, safety concerns remain regarding their chronic administration in PNS \nand CNS indications, and the development of novel compound classes and \nmodalities inhibiting HDAC6 function offer a way to mitigate some of these \nsafety concerns.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/14728222.2024.2404571",

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, \nMassachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Building 149, \nCharlestown, Boston, MA, 02129, USA.\n\nHistone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is one of the key histone deacetylases (HDACs) \nthat regulates various cellular functions including clearance of misfolded \nprotein and immunological responses. Considerable evidence suggests that HDAC6 \nis closely related to amyloid and tau pathology, the two primary hallmarks of \nAlzheimer's disease (AD). It is still unclear whether HDAC6 expression changes \nwith amyloid deposition in AD during disease progression or HDAC6 may be \nregulating amyloid phagocytosis or neuroinflammation or other neuropathological \nchanges in AD. In this work, the pathological accumulation of HDAC6 in AD brains \nover age as well as the relationship of its regulatory activity - with amyloid \npathogenesis and pathophysiological alterations is aimed to be enlightened using \nthe newly developed HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) PB118 in microglia BV2 cell and \n3D-AD human neural culture model. Results suggest that the structure-based \nrational design led to biologically compelling HDAC6i PB118 with multiple \nmechanisms that clear Aβ deposits by upregulating phagocytosis, improve \ntubulin/microtubule network by enhancing acetyl α-tubulin levels, regulate \ndifferent cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation, and \nsignificantly reduce phospho-tau (p-tau) levels associated with AD. These \nfindings indicate that HDAC6 plays key roles in the pathophysiology of AD and \npotentially serves as a suitable pharmacological target through chemical \nbiology-based drug discovery in AD.\n\n© 2023 The Authors.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and \nResearch Institute, Tampa, FL.\n\nHistone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is emerging as a novel therapeutic target in \ncancer treatment. HDAC6 plays an important role in cell migration, cell \ntransformation, and DNA damage response. Our and others' studies have linked \nHDAC6's functions and HDAC6's regulation to the mitogen-activated protein kinase \n(MAPK) pathways. In particular, HDAC6's activity has been found to be regulated \nby EGF-EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling. Inversely, HDAC6 has been reported to \nmodulate the functions of EGFR and Ras. In this review, we summarize the \nliterature on HDAC6 and MAPK pathways, and emphasize the interaction between \nHDAC6 and the ERK-MAPK signaling cascade.\n\nDOI: 10.1615/critrevoncog.2014012484",

HDAC6, unlike many other HDACs, is present \nin the cytoplasm. Its deacetylates non-histone proteins and plays diverse roles \nin cancer cell initiation, proliferation, autophagy, and anti-cancer drug \nresistance. The development of HDAC6-specific inhibitors has been relatively \nsuccessful. Mechanisms of HDAC6-promoted anti-cancer drug resistance, cancer \ncell proliferation, and autophagy are discussed. The relationship between \nautophagy and anti-cancer drug resistance is discussed. The effects of \ncombination therapy, which includes HDAC6 inhibitors, on the sensitivity of \ncancer cells to chemotherapeutics and immune checkpoint blockade are presented. \nA summary of clinical trials involving HDAC6-specific inhibitors is also \npresented. This review presents HDAC6 as a valuable target for developing \nanti-cancer drugs.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms23179592\nPMCID: PMC9455701",

In this review, we summarize the current evidence \nrelated to disease pathways in the axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease \n(CMT) and highlight the role of HDAC6 in these pathways. We hypothesize that \nHDAC6 might in fact actively contribute to the pathogenesis of certain forms of \naxonal CMT. HDAC6 plays a deacetylase activity-dependent, negative role in \naxonal transport and axonal regeneration, which are both processes implicated in \naxonal CMT. On the other hand, HDAC6 coordinates a protective response during \nelimination of toxic misfolded proteins, but this is mostly mediated independent \nof its deacetylase activity. The current mechanistic insights on these functions \nof HDAC6 in axonal CMT, along with the selective druggability against its \ndeacetylase activity, make the targeting of HDAC6 particularly attractive. We \nelaborate on the preclinical studies that demonstrated beneficial effects of \nHDAC6 inhibitors in axonal CMT models and outline possible modes of action. \nOverall, this overview ultimately provides a rationale for the use of \nsmall-molecule HDAC6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for this devastating \ndisease.\n\nCopyright © 2020 The Authors.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, \nMassachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Building 149, \nCharlestown, Boston, MA, 02129, USA.\n\nHistone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is one of the key histone deacetylases (HDACs) \nthat regulates various cellular functions including clearance of misfolded \nprotein and immunological responses. Considerable evidence suggests that HDAC6 \nis closely related to amyloid and tau pathology, the two primary hallmarks of \nAlzheimer's disease (AD). It is still unclear whether HDAC6 expression changes \nwith amyloid deposition in AD during disease progression or HDAC6 may be \nregulating amyloid phagocytosis or neuroinflammation or other neuropathological \nchanges in AD. In this work, the pathological accumulation of HDAC6 in AD brains \nover age as well as the relationship of its regulatory activity - with amyloid \npathogenesis and pathophysiological alterations is aimed to be enlightened using \nthe newly developed HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) PB118 in microglia BV2 cell and \n3D-AD human neural culture model. Results suggest that the structure-based \nrational design led to biologically compelling HDAC6i PB118 with multiple \nmechanisms that clear Aβ deposits by upregulating phagocytosis, improve \ntubulin/microtubule network by enhancing acetyl α-tubulin levels, regulate \ndifferent cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation, and \nsignificantly reduce phospho-tau (p-tau) levels associated with AD. These \nfindings indicate that HDAC6 plays key roles in the pathophysiology of AD and \npotentially serves as a suitable pharmacological target through chemical \nbiology-based drug discovery in AD.\n\n© 2023 The Authors.

However, HDAC6 in the healthy CNS functions via distinct \nmechanisms, due largely to its cytoplasmic localization. Indeed, in healthy \nneurons, cytoplasmic HDAC6 regulates the acetylation of a variety of non-histone \nproteins that are linked to separate functions, i.e., intracellular transport, \nneurotransmitter release, and aggregate formation. These three HDAC6 activities \ncould work independently or in synergy. Of particular interest, HDAC6 targets \nthe synaptic protein Bruchpilot and neurotransmitter release. In pathological \nconditions, HDAC6 becomes abundant in the nucleus, with deleterious consequences \nfor transcription regulation and synapses. Thus, HDAC6 plays a leading role in \nneuronal health or dysfunction. Here, we review recent findings and novel \nconclusions on the role of HDAC6 in neurodegeneration. Selective studies with \npan-HDACi are also included. We propose that an early alteration of HDAC6 \nundermines synaptic transmission, while altering transport and aggregation, \neventually leading to neurodegeneration.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/cells10010012\nPMCID: PMC7822434",

Epub 2024 Sep 20.\n\nTherapeutic indications for HDAC6 inhibitors in the peripheral and central \nnervous disorders.\n\nvan Eyll J(1), Prior R(2), Celanire S(1), Van Den Bosch L(3)(4), Rombouts F(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Augustine Therapeutics, Research and Development, Leuven, Belgium.\n(2)Priority Ventures, Kessel-Lo, Belgium.\n(3)Department of Neurosciences, Experimental Neurology and Leuven Brain \nInstitute (LBI), KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.\n(4)VIB, Center for Brain & Disease Research, Laboratory of Neurobiology, Leuven, \nBelgium.\n\nINTRODUCTION: Inhibition of the enzymatic function of HDAC6 is currently being \nexplored in clinical trials ranging from peripheral neuropathies to cancers. \nAdvances in selective HDAC6 inhibitor discovery allowed studying highly \nefficacious brain penetrant and peripheral restrictive compounds for treating \nPNS and CNS indications.\nAREAS COVERED: This review explores the multifactorial role of HDAC6 in cells, \nthe common pathological hallmarks of PNS and CNS disorders, and how HDAC6 \nmodulates these mechanisms. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 and genetic \nknockout/knockdown studies as a therapeutic strategy in PNS and CNS indications \nwere analyzed. Furthermore, we describe the recent developments in HDAC6 PET \ntracers and their utility in CNS indications. Finally, we explore the \nadvancements and challenges with HDAC6 inhibitor compounds, such as hydroxamic \nacid, fluoromethyl oxadiazoles, HDAC6 degraders, and thiol-based inhibitors.\nEXPERT OPINION: Based on extensive preclinical evidence, pharmacological \ninhibition of HDAC6 is a promising approach for treating both PNS and CNS \ndisorders, given its involvement in neurodegeneration and aging-related cellular \nprocesses. Despite the progress in the development of selective HDAC6 \ninhibitors, safety concerns remain regarding their chronic administration in PNS \nand CNS indications, and the development of novel compound classes and \nmodalities inhibiting HDAC6 function offer a way to mitigate some of these \nsafety concerns.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/14728222.2024.2404571",

Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 and genetic \nknockout/knockdown studies as a therapeutic strategy in PNS and CNS indications \nwere analyzed. Furthermore, we describe the recent developments in HDAC6 PET \ntracers and their utility in CNS indications. Finally, we explore the \nadvancements and challenges with HDAC6 inhibitor compounds, such as hydroxamic \nacid, fluoromethyl oxadiazoles, HDAC6 degraders, and thiol-based inhibitors.\nEXPERT OPINION: Based on extensive preclinical evidence, pharmacological \ninhibition of HDAC6 is a promising approach for treating both PNS and CNS \ndisorders, given its involvement in neurodegeneration and aging-related cellular \nprocesses. Despite the progress in the development of selective HDAC6 \ninhibitors, safety concerns remain regarding their chronic administration in PNS \nand CNS indications, and the development of novel compound classes and \nmodalities inhibiting HDAC6 function offer a way to mitigate some of these \nsafety concerns.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/14728222.2024.2404571",

Among the numerous malignant tumors in human, digestive system cancers \nare the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Acetylation and deacetylation \nare crucially involved in cancer occurrence and development; in addition, the \ndeacetylation process is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Among the 18 \nhuman HDACs that have been reported, HDAC6 has been widely studied. There is \nupregulated HDAC6 expression in numerous types of tumor tissues and is closely \nassociated with clinicopathological characteristics. Moreover, several HDAC6 \ninhibitors have been identified; furthermore, there has been extensive research \non their ability to inhibit the growth of many tumors.

Renal transplantation (RT) is one of the alternatively \npreferred treatments and the most cost-effective treatment approaches for the \ngreat majority of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). HDAC6 expression \nand activity have recently been shown to be increased in kidney disease in a \nnumber of studies. To date, a substantial amount of validated studies has \nidentified HDAC6 as a pivotal modulator of innate and adaptive immunity, and \nHDAC6 inhibitors (HDAC6i) are being developed and investigated for use in arrays \nof immune-related diseases, making HDAC6i a promising therapeutic candidate for \nthe management of a variety of renal diseases. Based on accumulating evidence, \nHDAC6i markedly open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention to protect \nagainst oxidative stress-induced damage, tip the balance in favor of the \ngeneration of tolerance-related immune cells, and attenuate fibrosis by \ninhibiting multiple activations of cell profibrotic signaling pathways.

Herein, we will \nelaborate on the unique function of HDAC6, which focuses on therapeutical \nmechanism of action related to immunological events with a general account of \nthe tantalizing potential to the clinic.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhang and Chang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1168848\nPMCID: PMC10401441",

However, HDAC6 in the healthy CNS functions via distinct \nmechanisms, due largely to its cytoplasmic localization. Indeed, in healthy \nneurons, cytoplasmic HDAC6 regulates the acetylation of a variety of non-histone \nproteins that are linked to separate functions, i.e., intracellular transport, \nneurotransmitter release, and aggregate formation. These three HDAC6 activities \ncould work independently or in synergy. Of particular interest, HDAC6 targets \nthe synaptic protein Bruchpilot and neurotransmitter release. In pathological \nconditions, HDAC6 becomes abundant in the nucleus, with deleterious consequences \nfor transcription regulation and synapses. Thus, HDAC6 plays a leading role in \nneuronal health or dysfunction. Here, we review recent findings and novel \nconclusions on the role of HDAC6 in neurodegeneration. Selective studies with \npan-HDACi are also included. We propose that an early alteration of HDAC6 \nundermines synaptic transmission, while altering transport and aggregation, \neventually leading to neurodegeneration.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/cells10010012\nPMCID: PMC7822434",

China.\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by sepsis contributes \nremarkably to the high mortality rate observed in intensive care units, largely \ndue to a lack of effective drug therapies. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a \nclass-IIb deacetylase that modulates non-nuclear protein functions via \ndeacetylation and ubiquitination. Importantly, HDAC6 has been shown to exert \nanti-cancer, anti-neurodegeneration, and immunological effects, and several \nHDAC6 inhibitors have now entered clinical trials. It has also been recently \nshown to modulate inflammation, and HDAC6 inhibition has been demonstrated to \nmarkedly suppress experimental sepsis. The present review summarizes the role of \nHDAC6 in sepsis-induced inflammation and endothelial barrier dysfunction in \nrecent years. It is proposed that HDAC6 inhibition predominantly ameliorates \nsepsis-induced ARDS by directly attenuating inflammation, which modulates the \ninnate and adaptive immunity, transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, and \nprotects endothelial barrier function. HDAC6 inhibition protects against \nsepsis-induced ARDS, thereby making HDAC6 a promising therapeutic target. \nHowever, HDAC inhibition may be associated with adverse effects on the embryo \nsac and oocyte, necessitating further studies.\n\nCopyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications.\n\nDOI: 10.3892/etm.2021.9866\nPMCID: PMC7967812",

Among the numerous malignant tumors in human, digestive system cancers \nare the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Acetylation and deacetylation \nare crucially involved in cancer occurrence and development; in addition, the \ndeacetylation process is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Among the 18 \nhuman HDACs that have been reported, HDAC6 has been widely studied. There is \nupregulated HDAC6 expression in numerous types of tumor tissues and is closely \nassociated with clinicopathological characteristics. Moreover, several HDAC6 \ninhibitors have been identified; furthermore, there has been extensive research \non their ability to inhibit the growth of many tumors. This review summarizes \nthe roles of HDAC6 in different primary digestive system malignancies.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Zhou, Liu and Tan.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcell.2021.719390\nPMCID: PMC8687743",

Therefore, HDAC6 has \nemerged as an attractive target for anticancer drug discovery in the past \ndecade. However, the development of conventional HDAC6 inhibitors has been \nhampered by their limited clinical efficacy, acquired resistance, and inability \nto inhibit non-enzymatic functions of HDAC6. To overcome these challenges, new \nstrategies, such as dual-acting inhibitors, targeted protein degradation (TPD) \ntechnologies (including PROTACs, HyT), are essential to enhance the anticancer \nactivity of HDAC6 inhibitors. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in \nthe design and development of HDAC6 modulators, including isoform-selective \nHDAC6 inhibitors, HDAC6-based dual-target inhibitors, and targeted protein \ndegraders (PROTACs, HyT), from the perspectives of rational design, \npharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical status. Finally, we discuss the \nchallenges and future directions for HDAC6-based drug discovery for cancer \ntherapy.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
